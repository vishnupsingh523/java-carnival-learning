# java-learning-carnival
<p> Those programs which I have practiced while learning JAVA are uploaded here. Which includes all teh basics of JAVA and some programs like : <br>

```
Fibonacci Series
Armstrong Number
Prime Number
Conditional Statements programs
Different method calling
initialisation of objects
Arrays : 1-D and 2-D
And many more ...
```

# Software-used
<li> Notepad </li>
<li> Command Line (Windows)</li>

```
NOTE: We can also use any IDE's like NETBEANS and others but for remembering the commands of java
 at the starting we should work in notepad and command-line only, this will increase our speed of
  typing and also decrease our laziness of typing long codes.
